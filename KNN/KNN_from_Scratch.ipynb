        "# Working of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN is one of the simplest yet surprisingly powerful algorithms in Machine Learning.  \n",
        "Instead of learning an explicit function, it makes predictions by **looking at the closest data points in the training set**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Intuition\n",
        "Imagine moving into a new neighborhood.  \n",
        "If you want to know which sports you might like, you could simply ask your *k* nearest neighbors.  \n",
        "- If most of them play football, chances are you will too.  \n",
        "- If most of them play basketball, you’ll likely pick that.  \n",
        "\n",
        "KNN works in the same way: **the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of the closest neighbors determines the prediction**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps of KNN\n",
        "1. **Store all the training data** (KNN is a \"lazy learner\" – it doesn’t build a model in advance).  \n",
        "2. **Choose a value of `k`** (number of neighbors to consider).  \n",
        "3. **For a new data point:**\n",
        "   - Compute its distance from all training points.  \n",
        "   - Pick the *k* nearest neighbors.  \n",
        "4. **Prediction:**\n",
        "   - For **classification** → majority vote of neighbors.  \n",
        "   - For **regression** → take the average of neighbors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Distance Metric\n",
        "The most common is **Euclidean distance**:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "d(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Other choices include Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, or Cosine similarity, depending on the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Points to Remember\n",
        "- Small `k` → high variance, more sensitive to noise (risk of overfitting).  \n",
        "- Large `k` → smoother boundaries, but risk of underfitting.  \n",
        "- Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler) is essential since distances are affected by different scales.  \n",
        "\n",
