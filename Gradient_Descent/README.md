# Gradient Descent ‚Äì A Complete Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Gradient Descent Learning Repository**!  
This repo is designed not just as a collection of code, but as a **step-by-step journey** into understanding one of the most fundamental optimization algorithms in Machine Learning.  

The goal here is simple:  
   Learn Gradient Descent from a **beginner‚Äôs perspective**  
   Build intuition with **visualizations and math**  
   Compare with **real implementations (like scikit-learn)**  
   Keep things clean, human, and recruiter-friendly

## What‚Äôs Inside  

This repo contains **Jupyter Notebooks**, each crafted carefully to explain **why Gradient Descent matters and how it works internally**.  

- **Introduction to Gradient Descent**  
  - What it is, why we need it, and where it fits in ML.  
  - Types of Gradient Descent (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-Batch).  
  - Gentle explanations with diagrams and equations.  

- **Batch Gradient Descent (Univariate Example)**  
  - Applied to Housing Dataset (California Housing).  
  - Derive parameters `w` and `b` manually.  
  - Implement Batch Gradient Descent step by step.  
  - Compare results with **sklearn‚Äôs Linear Regression**.  

- **Learning Rate Intuition**  
  - Why it matters.  
  - What happens when it‚Äôs too high or too low.  
  - Visual intuition to avoid common mistakes.  

- **(Coming Next: Extensions)**  
  - Multivariate Gradient Descent  
  - Stochastic & Mini-Batch Gradient Descent  
  - Practical trade-offs and real-world use

## Why This Repo?  

When I was learning Gradient Descent, I noticed most explanations were either:  
- **Too math-heavy** (scary for beginners), or  
- **Too code-only** (no intuition).  

This repo is my attempt to bridge that gap:  
‚úîÔ∏è Keep explanations simple but correct.  
‚úîÔ∏è Use **math only where needed** and always pair it with intuition.  
‚úîÔ∏è Show recruiters (and myself!) that I can explain **how things work under the hood**, not just use libraries.

## How to Use  

1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradient-descent.git
   cd gradient-descent
